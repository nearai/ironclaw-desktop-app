# Agent-controlled UI

Letting the IronClaw agent **see and drive the desktop app** the way a person
does — read what's on screen, navigate, open a thread, start a new chat — by
exposing the app's own actions to the model as **client-executed tools**.

## Status

The **client half is complete and shipped** (v0.4.93–v0.4.97), under
`src/lib/agent-ui/`:

| Module        | Role                   | Key exports                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `actions.ts`  | the registry ("drive") | `NAV_SURFACES`, `AgentUiHost`, `AgentAction`, `AgentActionResult`, `AGENT_ACTIONS`, `actionSchemas()`, `dispatchAction()` |
| `state.ts`    | the reader ("see")     | `UiStateSource`, `UiState`, `readUiState()`, `surfaceForPath()`, `redactSecrets()`                                        |
| `host.ts`     | real adapter           | `AgentUiHostDeps`, `createAgentUiHost()`                                                                                  |
| `delegate.ts` | the server seam        | `ClientToolCall`, `ClientToolResult`, `handleClientToolCall()`                                                            |

All four are pure (dependencies injected) and unit-tested. **What's missing for
end-to-end is server-side**: IronClaw's Responses API executes tools on the
server today, so it has no way to hand a tool call back to the client to run.
That extension is specified at the end of this doc; it needs the live backend
and is not built here.

## Principle: semantic actions, not DOM control

The agent never touches the DOM or pixels. It calls a **curated catalog of
named, typed, app-native actions** (`navigate`, `open_thread`, `new_chat`, …),
each with a JSON-Schema parameter shape. This is the deliberate opposite of
computer-use/`querySelector().click()`:

- **Robust** — survives UI refactors; the action is a contract, not a selector.
- **Bounded + safe** — the agent can only do what the catalog allows. `navigate`
  is restricted to real user-facing routes (`dev`/`mini`/`onboarding` excluded
  so the agent can't strand the user).
- **Explainable + testable** — each action is a small function with a result.
- **Reusable** — the same catalog can power the command palette for humans and
  client-executed tools for the agent. (The app already had this vocabulary in
  the palette + deep links; the registry formalizes it.)

The schemas double as the tool definitions the model sees (`actionSchemas()`).

## Data flow (end-to-end, once the server seam exists)

```
agent (server run) decides to call a UI tool
        │  (IronClaw must register the client tools on the run)
        ▼
IronClaw emits a `client_tool_call` event on the run's SSE stream and PAUSES
the run (same lifecycle as an approval gate)
        ▼
desktop client receives it →
  handleClientToolCall({ tool_call_id, name, arguments }, host)   [delegate.ts]
        │  parses object|JSON-string args; never throws
        ▼
  dispatchAction(name, args, host)                                [actions.ts]
        │  looks up the action; unknown → error result
        ▼
  action.run(args, host) → host.navigate / host.openThread / host.newChat
        │                                                         [host.ts]
        ▼
  goto(path) / rebornThreads.select(id|null)   (real app effects)
        ▼
delegate returns { tool_call_id, output, is_error }  (OpenAI function_call_output shape)
        ▼
desktop POSTs that envelope back → IronClaw resumes the run with the tool result
```

"See" works the same way or as auto-attached run context: the client builds a
`readUiState(source)` snapshot (current surface, active thread, open modal,
composer draft, connection status, profile) and hands it to the agent. It is
**redacted** — `redactSecrets()` masks bearer / `sk-` / GitHub / long-hex token
shapes (e.g. a token pasted into the composer), and `UiStateSource` has no
credential field by construction.

## Security model

- **Bounded catalog** — the agent can only invoke registered actions; the seed
  set is reversible/non-destructive (navigation, thread selection).
- **Graceful failure** — `dispatchAction` and `handleClientToolCall` never
  throw: an unknown action, bad JSON, non-object args, or an action-level
  failure all return `is_error: true` with a readable `output` the model can
  recover from.
- **Redacted reads** — secrets never ride in the state snapshot.
- **Future: gated mutations** — destructive actions (delete, send, settings
  changes) should route through the existing approval-gate / tool-policy system
  so they need a human tap; only safe, reversible actions auto-run.
- **No reentrancy** — UI tools manipulate the interface, never "send a message
  to myself" (the agent is already inside a run; that path is recursion).

## Wiring sketch (client, when the seam lands)

```ts
import { goto } from '$app/navigation';
import { rebornThreads } from '$lib/stores/reborn-threads.svelte';
import { createAgentUiHost } from '$lib/agent-ui/host';
import { handleClientToolCall } from '$lib/agent-ui/delegate';
import { actionSchemas } from '$lib/agent-ui/actions';

const host = createAgentUiHost({ goto, selectThread: (id) => rebornThreads.select(id) });

// register actionSchemas() as client tools when starting the run, then:
// on a `client_tool_call` SSE event:
const result = await handleClientToolCall(event, host);
// POST result back to IronClaw's submit-tool-output endpoint.
```

## IronClaw server extension (the remaining piece — for review)

Today (`/tmp/ironclaw-api.md` §Responses API, `POST /api/v1/responses`) the
Responses API accepts a `tools` array but **routes tool execution through
server-side agent middleware** — there is no caller-executed (function) tool
lifecycle exposed. To let the agent drive the _client_ UI, the run loop needs a
delegate-to-caller path. This mirrors OpenAI's function-call → `function_call_output`
loop and reuses IronClaw's existing gate (pause/resume) machinery:

1. **Register client tools on the run.** Accept caller-supplied tool definitions
   on run creation (or a session-scoped registration) and add them to the
   model's toolset, flagged as _client-executed_ (the server must not try to run
   them itself). The desktop sends `actionSchemas()`.
2. **Emit a pause event.** When the model calls a client tool, do **not**
   execute it. Emit an SSE event on the run stream —
   `{ type: "client_tool_call", run_id, tool_call_id, name, arguments }` — and
   **pause the run** exactly as a gate pauses it awaiting approval.
3. **Accept the tool output.** Add an endpoint to resume the run with the
   client's result, carrying delegate's envelope verbatim:
   `POST /api/.../runs/{run_id}/client-tool-output`
   `{ tool_call_id, output, is_error }`. Inject it as the tool result and
   continue the run.
4. **Timeout.** If the client never responds (disconnect, ignored), time the
   pause out and inject an error tool result so the run can't hang — same policy
   as a gate timeout.

If v0.29's "external tools in the Responses API" already supports a
function-call→submit-output round-trip, the desktop can use that directly and
this reduces to wiring; otherwise the WebChat v2 run loop needs the three
additions above (register / pause-event / submit-output), which the gate
lifecycle already models.

## Open questions

- **Read delivery**: a `get_ui_state` tool (agent pulls on demand) vs.
  auto-attaching a compact snapshot to each run as context. Hybrid likely best.
- **Action catalog growth**: `set_composer_text`, `open_settings_section`,
  `set_filter`, `pin_widget` — each verified against the real store API before
  adding, each classified safe vs. gated.
- **Command-palette reuse**: expose the same registry through the palette so
  humans exercise it now and the agent later (validates the catalog end-to-end
  without the server).
